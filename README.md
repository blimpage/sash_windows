Oh hi! This is the code for a scraper that runs daily [on Morph.io](https://morph.io/blimpage/sash_windows). It finds all of the sash windows available for sale at https://renovaterestorerecycle.com.au/, and sends an email (via Sendgrid) to a nominated email address if any new windows are found.

If that sounds incredibly niche and not very interesting, that's because it is!
